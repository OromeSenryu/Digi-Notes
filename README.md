Digi-Notes is a CRUD project designed to save your personal notes using a Gmail account.

## Prototype

The first step for starting the UI design was selecting a color palette and fonts not only for matching the theme, but taking on count contrast and image criteria to make sure that the final product offers a confortable experience for the user on any mobile screen.

Once the colors and fonts were set, the next step was start building the UI as an environment that resembles the digital style around the Digimon series and the decade it was created.

## Comments and learning experience

This was my very first project working with React! Of course it was pretty hard at the start, but once you get to understand the logic about components, hooks and state management... It's awesome.
